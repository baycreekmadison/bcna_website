Here's where you'll find information about snow removal, leaf removal, pet info, garbage/recycling, beach report, schools, library, other neighborhoods, bus schedules, dog exercise, etc.

Contacting (or be contacted by) Bay Creek residents
There are three methods to connect with Bay Creek residents online. These each have a different focus, outlined below.

The Bay Creek Calendar of Events (on Google Calendar): Learn about and participate in neighborhood events.
Use your browser to view it on the Bay Creek website or Google's website*, and/or use the Google Calendar app* to view it on your smart phone (* means you'll need a Google account). If you're already using Google Calendar, you can include Bay Creek events in it. You can configure how you want to receive notifications (email, popup, etc.).

Instructions for adding it to your phone's Calendar app are here. You'll need the calendar's address (cut/paste this); it's: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/a0t0g217k8fac3v3eef33lqr9g%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics

The Bay Creek Facebook Group: Positive communication, neighborly connections, and information for those living in the Bay Creek Neighborhood.
You'll use Facebook for this; sign up if you don't have an account. Once you have an account, go to our group and ask to join by clicking "Join Group". Someone will approve your request. Then read what others have posted, or post your own messages/pictures and other neighbors will see them.

The Bay Creek Discussion List (on Yahoo!Groups): Read or post neighborhood news and announcements, or discuss neighborhood issues through the Bay Creek discussion list.
You'll use email for this list, and here is how it works. After you subscribe to this list, you can send an email message to a single address that will be distributed to all other subscribers. Likewise, when someone else posts a message, you'll receive it via email.

To subscribe to this, send a blank email message to baycreek-subscribe@yahoogroups.com (or use their website). You'll receive a welcoming message back with instructions, usually within a day, with a confirmation request to which you should respond. Check your SPAM folder if you don't see it. After your membership has been approved, you may post a message by sending email to baycreek@yahoogroups.com . Yahoo Groups doesn't notify us of about 7% of new member requests... if you aren't approved within a day, contact the web committee (see below).

You may want to create an email filter for the list so email doesn't go directly to your inbox... occasionally there is a lot of conversation.
