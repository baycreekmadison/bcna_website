      Bay Creek, a neighborhood nestled between Monona Bay and Wingra Creek located on the near south side of Madison, Wisconsin. The name Bay Creek was chosen to reflect the fact that the borders of this neighborhood are almost entirely water. We got new water in our midst some years ago; the city pool opened in 2006.
