Funk Factory & Arboretum
Almost a year ago Levi Funk of the Funk Factory was
walking through the UW Arboretum with his family.
His son started playing with Osage oranges on the
ground. When Levi smelled the oranges, he thought
they might work well in beer. His wife reached out to
the Arboretum and they went through the process of
getting approval.
Funk Factory made two beers, Osage orange
and American persimmon. The beer was bottled
in December after it had aged in foeders for three
months followed by two months aging on fruit. The
beers were introduced at an event with the Arboretum
during Madison Craft Beer Week in May. “You never
know how people are going to respond when it comes
to these odd ball fruits. Something like Osage orange
especially. A lot of people know what they are, but no
one has ever used them in a culinary manner…. Madison’s…
interest in these kinds of things continues to
surprise me.” Levi thinks they were very well received.
Future plans are to continue making beers
with whatever fruits or ingredients the Arboretum
can sustainably supply. Flowering quince and Harbin
pears (similar to American persimmon) may be on the
horizon for this winter depending on the crop size.
4th of July
Celebration
Mr. Bunny (pictured

Planning & Economic Development
(P&ED) Report
By Alexandria Elias and Carrie Rothburd
Neighborhood Needs Assessment: BCNA received a
grant from the City of Madison to conduct a needs
assessment focusing on Bay Creek and the South Park
corridor. Led by Professor Gary Green and his students,
work on the assessment will begin in September. We
are looking for volunteers from Bay Creek, Greenbush,
Bram’s Addition, Burr Oaks, and Capital View Heights
to be involved in this effort. Contact Carrie Rothburd at
crothburd@gmail.com if interested.
Truman Olson Site: The Truman Olson Selection Committee
meetings were suspended after Welton and
Hovde/SSM requested a hiatus on July 11th. The next
meeting is expected to occur sometime late September
or early October.
At the July meeting, BCNA voted to submit a
letter to the Truman Olson Selection Committee and the
Plan Department to request the Committee postpone
its recommendations about the future of this parcel
until BCNA’s needs assessment is complete to allow for
a better educated decision. This letter also requests that
the city: undertake a comprehensive grocery store needs
analysis similar to the South Madison Food Enterprise
study of 2013; secure ongoing operation of the Pick ‘n
Save through construction of a new grocery store at
1402; and ensure adequate time for neighborhood input.
The letter communicates additional concerns,
drawn from P&ED’s earlier survey, about the plans proposed
to date: the importance of integrating 1402 development
smoothly into adjacent communities; protecting
Cedar Street’s existing character; and establishing a balance
among housing, commercial, and community space
on the site that meets community needs.
Grocery Store Needs Assessment: On June 14 P&ED
hosted a meeting about the future of a grocery store at or
near 1402 S Park Street. Neighbors from six South Madison
neighborhood associations, staff from the mayor’s
office, and representatives of SSM/Hovde, Urban Assets,
and Willy Street Cooperative attended. As follow-up,
P&ED is conducting a survey on grocery store needs
open to neighbors in Bay Creek, Monona Bay, Greenbush,
Bram’s Addition, Burr Oaks, and Capital View
Heights. The survey is available online at:
https://goo.gl/forms/sGxaX0c2Uvxu6EPO2.
For a paper copy, please contact Alex Elias at (973) 803-
9716 or Judy Robinson at (608) 469-1218. The survey is
open July 24 - August 24, 2018.
Heartland Housing is moving forward to gain city approval
to develop 1202 S Park Street into a 58-unit building
(49 studios and 9 one-bedroom apartments) with
a library, computer lab, and multi-purpose room for
residents, and offices for supportive services and property
management. The 5-story, 48,000 square-foot building
(4-stories above grade and a roof level) will include
1,200 square feet of commercial space. See: http://www.
cityofmadison.com/council/district13/development/. It
requires a land use application for a conditional use permit
for a greater-than-40,000-square-foot building and
Urban Design Commission approval. Heartland plans
to submit its application by August 15, 2018. Neighbors
have expressed the need for more parking and groundlevel
green space to Heartland.
Chris Farley House Expansion: Catholic Charities has
operated the property at 810 W Olin Avenue as a 16-bed
licensed residential and outpatient treatment facility for
men and women struggling with addiction for the past
20 years. Catholic Charities is considering taking the
building down to the studs for renovations or demolishing
the building and erecting a new facility in its place.
A third plan entails purchasing the property at 814 W
Olin, combining the two properties, and either demolishing
814 and building an extension onto the renovated
property at 810 or demolishing both buildings and constructing
a new facility spanning both parcels. Catholic
Charities is working with P&ED to call a neighborhood
meeting to get feedback from the neighborhood on its
proposed options.
Alliant Energy Center Comprehensive Master Plan
Oversight Committee is on phase 3 of a 4-phase effort
to develop the AEC campus. Perkins + Will consultants
have begun comprehensive master planning. The next
meeting with the county’s oversight committee is at 3:00
pm, August 20, at the Alliant Energy Center. See https://
dane.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx for an agenda. Send
feedback to aecvision@countyofdane.com. For the locations
and times of upcoming meetings for public input,
go to baycreekmadison.org: September (draft alternatives
overview), October (campus master plan draft
review), November (discussion with adjoining neighborhoods).

Learn to prevent falls with Stepping On Classes
One in every four adults over age 65 falls every year. But falling is not normal for older adults and older adults can
learn how to take steps to prevent falls.
Stepping On will be offered at the Madison Baha’i Center located at 324 W. Lakeside St., Madison on
Thursdays from September 13 – October 25 from 1:00pm – 3:00pm. The workshop is for adults age 60 and over
who live in their own homes or apartments and do not rely on a walker, scooter, or wheelchair indoors most of the
time.
Fear of falling often limits older adults and results in reduced mobility and isolation. Stepping On workshops
are taught by two certified leaders; either one or both are health care or aging network professionals and
another is a peer leader who has already taken the workshop.
During the seven-week session, participants receive support from trained leaders and other workshop participants,
learning strength and balance exercises from a local physical therapist, medications’ impact on falls from
a local pharmacist, impact of poor vision as a falls risk from a local eye professional, safe footwear, home modifications,
and community safety.
To register, please contact Becky Otte-Ford at raonine@gmail.com or 608-215-4119.
This workshop is free of charge. Participants may offer a donation to Safe Communities of Madison-Dane
County, if they wish.

Book on Importance of Public Lands by Bay Creek resident Steve Davis
From Isthmus.com
Steven Davis, a professor of political science and environmental studies at Edgewood College in Madison, has written
a new book titled In Defense of Public Lands, a comprehensive argument for why public land ought to remain
firmly in the public’s hands.
Debates continue to rage over the merits or flaws of public land and whether or not it should be privatized
— or at least radically reconfigured in some way. In Defense of Public Lands offers a comprehensive refutation of
the market-oriented arguments. Steven Davis passionately advocates that public land ought to remain firmly in the
public’s hands. He reviews empirical data and theoretical arguments from biological, economic, and political perspectives
in order to build a case for why our public lands are an invaluable and irreplaceable asset for the American
people.
If you would like to learn more, Steve will be giving a talk on August 17 at 7:00 at the Mystery to Me Bookstore
at 1863 Monroe St. right near Edgewood.
Mayor’s Neighborhood Conference 2018
The 2018 Mayor’s Neighborhood Conference will take

places to live and do business.
What to expect at the November 17th event?

community organizations, and governmental representation
(and more). It is a place where people can ask questions,
share their experiences, and explore ways they can
become more involved in making Madison an exciting,
equitable, inclusive, and great place to live. The Mayor
will kick-off the day with a Welcome Address and Q &
A session. Afterwards, you can choose workshops, table
conversations, or other dynamic opportunities to discuss,
meet, and network with others.

all over the world should be concerned about its effects.
We will also consider methods that allow us to be prepared
and the various ways in which we are inherently safe
here on Earth.

FOOT Notes
By Andria Blattner
Much like last year this summer has really been a
challenge – high heat and humidity which have led to
much distress to both plants and animals. It has also
produced very high populations of mosquitoes. In
Wisconsin there are 56 species of mosquitos. Studies
this year at UW showed that Little Brown Bats eat 15
of the 56 species of mosquitoes and 72% of the samples
and all the 22 sites studied had some mosquito remains.
Nine of species consumed were known to carry disease
causing viruses. This shows the widespread effectiveness
of the Little Brown Bats at removing mosquitoes.
The decrease of little brown bats due to White Nose
Syndrome has not helped at all.
There is a new volunteer project in the Turville
Prairie. This was instigated by a Master Naturalist who
volunteered at a Turville work day and wanted to work
on a project. Our prairie is mostly grasses so the project
is to add diversity to the prairie by planting a variety of
forbs (flowering plants – not grasses.) It is slow going
digging in the prairie – the sod-busting of the old days,
but really nice to be outside (with mosquito repellant,
of course). If you have any prairie plants or would like
to help, please contact me. We can use more help and
more plants to add if they are native prairie plants.
Bluebirds did not do well this year, similar to last
year. There was only one Bluebird nest out of 10 boxes.
There were 5 fledglings in that nest. I hope they are ok,
they were just ready to leave the nest during the Ironman
weekend. There were tents very near the nest box
and people around all weekend. I haven’t seen them
since but I’m hoping for the best. Radhika and Meera
Bradley who monitor the Quann–Goodman Trail this
summer did not have any Bluebirds nesting either. I’m
hoping to set up a few more houses close to the existing
ones on the theory that Tree Swallows will not allow
competitors to nest too close. That might allow the
Bluebirds access to a box.
Our Bird and Nature Walks are on the 2nd Sunday
of each month at 1:30. On August 12 the walk will be
led by Carrie Calkins whose interest is Nature Mindfulness.
September 9 is to be announced. Ron Shutvet will
lead a History Walk on October 14. It will cover the
history of the Olin and Turville Parks from geological
times through prehistory to the settling the land by the
Turville family in the 1850’s.
In September FOOT will sponsor dances in the Pavilion,
dates to be determined. Please check the FOOT website
at olin-turville.org for updates or look on Facebook at

Generated Solar Energy
From: Madison Gas and Electric
Customer support helped launch Madison Gas and Electric’s
(MGE) Shared Solar program about a year and a
half ago. Customers who subscribed to the program support
solar power generated by an array on the roof of the
Middleton Municipal Operations Center. The voluntary
program sold out quickly!
Now, MGE is preparing for Shared Solar’s expansion,
which will give more customers the opportunity to participate
and grow solar energy in our community. MGE
is adding customers to a waiting list in anticipation of
the program’s expansion.
Program participation is easy and affordable. Join our
waiting list at www.mge.com/sharedsolar and be among
the first to learn about our next steps. This limited opportunity
will be available to customers on a first-come,
first-served basis.
Features of Shared Solar
Shared Solar is convenient and simple. Participants:
• Subscribe for up to 50% of their annual electricity use.
• Pay a one-time up-front fee and a fixed per-kilowatthour
rate for solar.
• Pay the standard rate for the rest of their electricity.
• Take solar with them if they move within MGE’s electric
service area.
•Reserve their spot for 25 years but may exit at any
time.
Working together to reach shared goals
Shared Solar helps grow solar in our community. It
also advances MGE’s Energy 2030 framework, which
includes our goal of supplying 30% renewable energy
by 2030.
Join us in the Shared Solar program as we work toward
shared energy goals for our community. Stay tuned for
more details about the expansion and to learn about our
other clean energy projects.
